Do not feel that you have to use this, but any structure you do use should use appropriate directory names. If you want to use Initilizer to set up a quick structure like this go ahead it will help you set up default Bootstrap profiles as well. http://www.initializr.com/\r Be warned though do non submit a non-customised css template or framework as you will not get many marks for it.",
